# Kazakhstan-OCDS-Transformation-and-Analytics

## EBRD GPA TC Facility – Support in Accession to the Agreement on Government Procurement of the World Trade Organization. Assignment: Kazakhstan: Public Procurement Reporting Module for the National eProcurement System.
<p>

### Description: 
Data is extracted from the existing electronic public procurement system, which continues to operate, and transformed to the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) and published. A business intelligence module is run on top of it, accessing the data via an Application Programme Interface (API). This provides government procurement policy makers with a tool to analyse and visualise procurement trends. 

### Project timeline:
2018 – 2019	
### Project status: 
Fully deployed

## Context and problem statement
<p>
In 2017, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan sent a request letter to the EBRD related to the changes needed to be introduced to the country’s public procurement system to negotiate accession to WTO GPA. The request specifically referred to the need to understand better the functioning of the electronic procurement system in Ukraine. Ukraine has a well-functioning electronic procurement system, and, benefiting from the Bank’s assistance, developed a set of tools and practices for monitoring and reporting on public procurement.
To address this request, the EBRD Legal Transition Programme (LTP) experts have designed a new assignment under the auspices of the EBRD GPA TC Facility (the “Assignment”) to assist the government with the development of a public procurement reporting tool for the national electronic procurement system (the “eProcurement System”). 
<p>
  The problems identified in Kazakhstan during the project inception stage were as follows:
* There wasn’t an automated workflow management capability accessible to all public procurement process stakeholders. 
*	Information regarding procurement procedures and public contracts, while stored electronically, was very difficult to retrieve. 
*	Stored public procurement data was unstructured and this made it difficult to deliver reliable and accurate research results;
*	The transactional data was unavailable;  
*	The approach used for reporting was considered inefficient, unreliable, time-consuming, and hard to verify. 

## Objectives and vision
Working with the EBRD GPA Technical Cooperation Facility, the Ministry of Finance aimed to modernise its public procurement system, ensuring it can draw on the data stored within its national eProcurement system to drive improved public procurement policies and decisions. It aimed to: 

*	Provide improved public procurement statistics to guide decision making;
*	Generate automated public procurement reports;

The EBRD-developed vision to achieve these objectives contains two primary points:

*	Implementation of an open contracting data standard (OCDS) transformation on existing eProcurement data;
*	Deployment of an OCDS-based set of business intelligence and reporting tools to enable analysis of public procurement data.

## Technological solution and implementation

The developed solution extracts data from the existing eProcurement system and converts it to the OCDS standard while allowing the legacy solutions to continue running unaffected. Once the data has been converted to the OCDS it is consolidated in one database. The reporting module for public authorities has been set up, which access this data directly through an API. The public procurement reporting module allows users to analyse the eProcurement data and view it through a number of different angles and filters. The overall result is a publicly accessible contract register together with the business intelligence tools to dig into and analyse the contract data.

## Results and future expectations

As a result of the project, Kazakhstan now has a national-level public procurement data analytical infrastructure. This system enables a previously impossible level of vision over procurement spending within the country, and enables various types of big data analysis.
In terms of the goals set for the project, the OCDS-based analytical system:

*	Enables the automated generation of public procurement reports – through the “Explorer” analytical tool 
*	Provides support for public administration regarding public procurement decisions – Government employees are able to use the “Explorer” tool to analyse public procurement data and guide their procurement decisions. 

Evidence that policy makers are making use of the business intelligence tool they now have to guide their decisions came with the passing of new legislation on how to deal with procurement complaints. The new system provided evidence regarding the inefficiencies of the existing review and complaints process for public procurement procedures. The new law reforming these procedures was passed as a result of having access to this data.

Going forward, the impact of the project could be increased by allocating resources and budget to training and outreach programmes to promote the use of the business intelligence tools not just within the Ministry of Finance, but in agencies and departments across the Government. The tools and spending data now available, could be used to guide decision-making not just for public procurement specialists but for policy makers across different policy fields.

### Impact: 

* Enables public procurement policy makers to take data-driven decisions; 
* Provides for the automated generation of public procurement reports;
